## Preconditions
|#| StepName | Step Description | Expected Result |
|-|---------|-----------------|----------------|
| 1 | Verify that the WPEFramework process is running on the device. | WPEFramework process should be up and running in the device. | Ensure that WPEFramework should be active and running on the device. |
| 2 | Verify that the BOLT package host path is configured correctly. | MediaValidationVariables.bolt_packages_base_path must be configured with the BOLT packages hosting server URL.<br>(E.g. `http://<TM_IP>:/images/signed-packages/`) | Ensure that the BOLT package host path is configured and accessible. |
| 3 | Verify that the BOLT app download URL resolves correctly. | MediaValidationVariables.animation_app_download_url is derived from the base path and must resolve to the BOLT app package URL. | Ensure that the BOLT app package URL is valid and accessible for download. |
| 4 | Verify that the required interval configuration is set correctly. | MediaValidationVariables.operation_max_interval should be set to the maximum operation interval value (in seconds). | Ensure that the required configuration value is set correctly. |
| 5 | Check whether the app is already installed on the device. | Query the installed package list using the following request: <br><code>{"jsonrpc": "2.0", "id": 1234567890, "method": "org.rdk.PackageManagerRDKEMS.1.listPackages"}</code>. | Verify that the app is installed on the device. |
| 6 | Download the app package when it is not already available. | If the app is not installed, then download the package using the following request: <br><code>{"jsonrpc": "2.0", "id": 1234567890, "method": "org.rdk.DownloadManager.1.download", "params": {"url": "<app_download_url>"}}</code>. | Ensure that the app package is downloaded successfully. |
| 7 | Install the downloaded app package through PackageManager. | Install the package using the following request: <br><code>{"jsonrpc": "2.0", "id": 1234567890, "method": "org.rdk.PackageManagerRDKEMS.install", "params": {"packageId": "com.rdkcentral.animation-app", "version": "0.1.0", "additionalMetadata": [{"name": "type", "value": "native/dac-app"}], "fileLocator": "<PACKAGEMANAGER_FILE_LOCATOR>/package<download_id>"}}</code>. | Confirm that the app package is installed successfully on the device. |

## Test Steps

|#| StepName | Step Description | Expected Result |
|-|---------|-----------------|----------------|
| 1 | Set playback operations and build the animation app test URL. | Configure the playback operations (pause, play, stop, replay from beginning, stop immediately, start playback, stop) and build the test URL for the Animation app with these operations embedded as query parameters. | Ensure that the playback operations are configured and the test URL is built successfully. |
| 2 | Store the launch URL in PersistentStore. | Store the constructed URL in PersistentStore for AppManager launch. <br>Sample URL: `http://<TM_IP>:<port>/tdkservice/fileStore/lightning-apps/animations/build/index.html?operations=pause,play,stop,replay,stopNow,start,stop&autotest=true`| Ensure that the launch URL is stored in PersistentStore. |
| 3 | Launch the app through AppManager. | Launch the test app through AppManager using the URL stored in PersistentStore using the following request: <br><code>{"jsonrpc":"2.0", "id":1, "method":"org.rdk.AppManager.1.launchApp", "params":{"appId": "com.rdkcentral.animation-app"}}</code>. | Ensure that the app launches successfully via AppManager. |
| 4 | Check loaded apps and verify app presence. | Check whether the app is listed in loaded apps using the following request: <br><code>{"jsonrpc": "2.0", "id": 1234567890, "method": "org.rdk.AppManager.getLoadedApps"}</code>. | Verify that com.rdkcentral.animation-app is present in the loaded apps list. |
| 5 | Execute operations and validate media events. | App performs the provided operations and validates each operation using events. | Ensure that expected media events are observed for the configured operations. |
| 6 | Monitor animation progress. | Monitor animation progress. | Ensure that the 'pause, play, stop, replay, stopNow, start, stop' event should be received and animation completes successfully. Ensure that the validation result and average CPU load value should be retrieved. |
| 7 | Run animation operations and validate outcomes. | Validates the 'pause, play, stop, replay, stopNow, start, stop' event (animation completes successfully) and retrieves the validation result with average CPU load value. Get the event validation result from the app and update the test script status. | Ensure that animation operations complete successfully without errors. |
| 8 | Terminate app and restore test environment. | Terminate the test app through AppManager using the following request: <br><code>{"jsonrpc":"2.0", "id":1, "method":"org.rdk.AppManager.1.terminateApp", "params":{"appId": "com.rdkcentral.animation-app"}}</code> and restore the test environment. | Ensure that the app is terminated and the test environment is restored. |
