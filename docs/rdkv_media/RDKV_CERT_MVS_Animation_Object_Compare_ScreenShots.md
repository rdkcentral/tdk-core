## Objective
To launch a Lightning Object Animation application via AppManager to render a rectangle and validate animation operation using screen shot comparison. The test confirms that the animation renders the specified object correctly by capturing a screenshot during rendering and comparing it against a reference image.

## Preconditions
|#| Step Name | Step Description | Expected Result |
|-|---------|-----------------|----------------|
| 1 | Verify that the WPEFramework process is running on the device. | WPEFramework process should be up and running in the device. | WPEFramework should be active and running on the device. |
| 2 | Verify that the BOLT package host path is configured correctly. | MediaValidationVariables.bolt_packages_base_path must be configured with the BOLT packages hosting server URL.<br>(E.g. `http://<TM_IP>:<port>/images/signed-packages/`) | Ensure that the BOLT package host path is configured and accessible. |
| 3 | Verify that the BOLT app download URL resolves correctly. | MediaValidationVariables.object_animation_app_download_url is derived from the base path and must resolve to the BOLT app package URL. | Ensure that the BOLT app package URL is valid and accessible for download. |
| 4 | Verify that the required configuration is set correctly. | MediaValidationVariables.image_upload_dir should be set to the directory path for image uploads. | Verify that MediaValidationVariables.image_upload_dir is configured with the required value. |
| 5 | Check whether the app is already installed on the device. | Query the installed package list using the following request: <br><code>{"jsonrpc": "2.0", "id": 1234567890, "method": "org.rdk.PackageManagerRDKEMS.1.listPackages"}</code>. | Verify that the app is installed on the device. |
| 6 | Download the app package when it is not already available. | If the app is not installed, then download the package using the following request: <br><code>{"jsonrpc": "2.0", "id": 1234567890, "method": "org.rdk.DownloadManager.1.download", "params": {"url": "<app_download_url>"}}</code>. | Ensure that the app package is downloaded successfully. |
| 7 | Install the downloaded app package through PackageManager. | Install the package using the following request: <br><code>{"jsonrpc": "2.0", "id": 1234567890, "method": "org.rdk.PackageManagerRDKEMS.install", "params": {"packageId": "com.rdkcentral.object-animation-app", "version": "0.1.0", "additionalMetadata": [{"name": "type", "value": "native/dac-app"}], "fileLocator": "<PACKAGEMANAGER_FILE_LOCATOR>/package<download_id>"}}</code>. | Confirm that the app package is installed successfully on the device. |

## Test Steps
|#| Step Name | Step Description | Expected Result |
|-|---------|-----------------|----------------|
| 1 | Set playback operations for the scenario. | Configure the animation app URL with parameters: `object=Rect` (renders Rectangles only), `count=1` object, `duration=180` seconds. | Ensure playback operations are set as specified. |
| 2 | Store the launch URL in PersistentStore. | Store the constructed URL in PersistentStore for AppManager launch. <br>Sample URL: `http://<TM_IP>:<port>/tdkservice/fileStore/lightning-apps/objectanimations/build/index.html?port=<device_port>&object=Rect&showfps=false&count=1&duration=180&autotest=true` | Ensure that the launch URL is stored in PersistentStore. |
| 3 | Launch the app through AppManager. | Launch the test app through AppManager using the URL stored in PersistentStore using the following request: <br><code>{"jsonrpc":"2.0", "id":1, "method":"org.rdk.AppManager.1.launchApp", "params":{"appId": "com.rdkcentral.object-animation-app"}}</code>. | Ensure that the app launches successfully via AppManager. |
| 4 | Check loaded apps and verify app presence. | Check whether the app is listed in loaded apps using the following request: <br><code>{"jsonrpc": "2.0", "id": 1234567890, "method": "org.rdk.AppManager.getLoadedApps"}</code>. | Verify that com.rdkcentral.object-animation-app is present in the loaded apps list. |
| 5 | Run animation rendering and capture screenshot for comparison. | The animation app renders a rectangle object for the configured duration. A screenshot is captured during rendering and uploaded to the configured directory. The captured screenshot is then compared against the reference image to validate that the animation object is rendering correctly. | Ensure that the screenshot is captured during animation rendering for comparison. |
| 6 | Validate screenshot comparison result and update test result. | If the screenshot comparison confirms that the animation object is rendering as expected, the app reports SUCCESS, otherwise FAILURE. The test result is updated as SUCCESS or FAILURE based on the screenshot comparison result and process check status. | Ensure that the test result is updated as SUCCESS or FAILURE based on the screenshot comparison result. |
| 7 | Terminate app and restore test environment. | Terminate the test app through AppManager using the following request: <br><code>{"jsonrpc":"2.0", "id":1, "method":"org.rdk.AppManager.1.terminateApp", "params":{"appId": "com.rdkcentral.object-animation-app"}}</code> and restore the test environment. | Ensure that the app is terminated and the test environment is restored. |
