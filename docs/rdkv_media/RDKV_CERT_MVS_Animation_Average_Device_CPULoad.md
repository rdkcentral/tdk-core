## Objective
To launch a Lightning Animation application via AppManager and check whether the average device CPU load value calculated for 60 sec duration is as expected. The test confirms that the average device CPU load during animation rendering over the configured duration is within the expected threshold.

## Preconditions
|#| Step Name | Step Description | Expected Result |
|-|---------|-----------------|----------------|
| 1 | Verify that the WPEFramework process is running on the device. | WPEFramework process should be up and running in the device. | WPEFramework should be active and running on the device. |
| 2 | Verify that the BOLT package host path is configured correctly. | MediaValidationVariables.bolt_packages_base_path must be configured with the BOLT packages hosting server URL.<br>(E.g. `http://<TM_IP>:<port>/images/signed-packages/`) | Ensure that the BOLT package host path is configured and accessible. |
| 3 | Verify that the BOLT app download URL resolves correctly. | MediaValidationVariables.animation_app_download_url is derived from the base path and must resolve to the BOLT app package URL. | Ensure that the BOLT app package URL is valid and accessible for download. |
| 4 | Check whether the app is already installed on the device. | Query the installed package list using the following request: <br><code>{"jsonrpc": "2.0", "id": 1234567890, "method": "org.rdk.PackageManagerRDKEMS.1.listPackages"}</code>. | Verify that the app is installed on the device. |
| 5 | Download the app package when it is not already available. | If the app is not installed, then download the package using the following request: <br><code>{"jsonrpc": "2.0", "id": 1234567890, "method": "org.rdk.DownloadManager.1.download", "params": {"url": "<app_download_url>"}}</code>. | Ensure that the app package is downloaded successfully. |
| 6 | Install the downloaded app package through PackageManager. | Install the package using the following request: <br><code>{"jsonrpc": "2.0", "id": 1234567890, "method": "org.rdk.PackageManagerRDKEMS.install", "params": {"packageId": "com.rdkcentral.animation-app", "version": "0.1.0", "additionalMetadata": [{"name": "type", "value": "native/dac-app"}], "fileLocator": "<PACKAGEMANAGER_FILE_LOCATOR>/package<download_id>"}}</code>. | Confirm that the app package is installed successfully on the device. |

## Test Steps
|#| Step Name | Step Description | Expected Result |
|-|---------|-----------------|----------------|
| 1 | Set playback operations for the scenario. | Configure the `stop(60)` operation: the animation will render for 60 seconds and then stop. | Ensure playback operations are set as specified. |
| 2 | Store the launch URL in PersistentStore. | Store the constructed URL in PersistentStore for AppManager launch. <br>Sample URL: `http://<TM_IP>:<port>/tdkservice/fileStore/lightning-apps/animations/build/index.html?operations=stop(60)&autotest=true` | Ensure that the launch URL is stored in PersistentStore. |
| 3 | Launch the app through AppManager. | Launch the test app through AppManager using the URL stored in PersistentStore using the following request: <br><code>{"jsonrpc":"2.0", "id":1, "method":"org.rdk.AppManager.1.launchApp", "params":{"appId": "com.rdkcentral.animation-app"}}</code>. | Ensure that the app launches successfully via AppManager. |
| 4 | Check loaded apps and verify app presence. | Check whether the app is listed in loaded apps using the following request: <br><code>{"jsonrpc": "2.0", "id": 1234567890, "method": "org.rdk.AppManager.getLoadedApps"}</code>. | Verify that com.rdkcentral.animation-app is present in the loaded apps list. |
| 5 | Run animation rendering and capture CPU load metrics. | The animation app renders the configured animation for the specified duration. The device CPU load is monitored periodically during rendering. After the configured stop time, the animation halts and the average CPU load is calculated from all measurements collected during the rendering period. | Ensure that the CPU load measurements are captured during the animation rendering period. |
| 6 | Validate average CPU load result and update test result. | If the calculated average device CPU load is within the expected threshold, the app reports SUCCESS, otherwise FAILURE. The test result is updated as SUCCESS or FAILURE based on the CPU load validation result and process check status. | Ensure that the test result is updated as SUCCESS or FAILURE based on the CPU load validation result. |
| 7 | Terminate app and restore test environment. | Terminate the test app through AppManager using the following request: <br><code>{"jsonrpc":"2.0", "id":1, "method":"org.rdk.AppManager.1.terminateApp", "params":{"appId": "com.rdkcentral.animation-app"}}</code> and restore the test environment. | Ensure that the app is terminated and the test environment is restored. |
