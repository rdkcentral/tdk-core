## Preconditions
|#| StepName | Step Description | Expected Result |
|-|---------|-----------------|----------------|
| 1 | Verify that the WPEFramework process is running on the device. | WPEFramework process should be up and running in the device. | WPEFramework should be active and running on the device. |
| 2 | Verify that the BOLT package host path is configured correctly. | MediaValidationVariables.bolt_packages_base_path must be configured with the BOLT packages hosting server URL.<br>(E.g. http://<TM_IP>:<port>/images/signed-packages/) | Ensure that the BOLT package host path is configured and accessible. |
| 3 | Verify that the BOLT app download URL resolves correctly. | MediaValidationVariables.unified_player_app_download_url is derived from the base path and must resolve to the BOLT app package URL. | Ensure that the BOLT app package URL is valid and accessible for download. |
| 4 | Check whether the app is already installed on the device. | Query the installed package list using the following request: <br><code>{"jsonrpc": "2.0", "id": 1234567890, "method": "org.rdk.PackageManagerRDKEMS.1.listPackages"}</code>. | Verify that the app is installed on the device. |
| 5 | Download the app package when it is not already available. | If the app is not installed, then download the package using the following request: <br><code>{"jsonrpc": "2.0", "id": 1234567890, "method": "org.rdk.DownloadManager.1.download", "params": {"url": "<app_download_url>"}}</code>. | Ensure that the app package is downloaded successfully. |
| 6 | Install the downloaded app package through PackageManager. | Install the package using the following request: <br><code>{"jsonrpc": "2.0", "id": 1234567890, "method": "org.rdk.PackageManagerRDKEMS.install", "params": {"packageId": "com.rdkcentral.lightning-unified-player", "version": "0.1.0", "additionalMetadata": [{"name": "type", "value": "native/dac-app"}], "fileLocator": "<PACKAGEMANAGER_FILE_LOCATOR>/package<download_id>"}}</code>. | Confirm that the app package is installed successfully on the device. |

## Test Steps

|#| StepName | Step Description | Expected Result |
|-|---------|-----------------|----------------|
| 1 | Set playback operations for the scenario. | Configure the `checkloop(30)` operations: the video will loop continuously for 30 seconds. The loop count is calculated from how many times the video repeats within that duration (e.g., a 15-second video looping for 30 seconds = 2 loops). | Ensure playback operations are set as specified. |
| 2 | Build the test URL using video_src_url_short_duration_dash. | Build the test URL with the video_src_url_short_duration_dash (DASH stream). | Verify that the test URL is built using video_src_url_short_duration_dash. |
| 3 | Store the launch URL in PersistentStore. | Store the constructed URL in PersistentStore for AppManager launch. <br>Sample URL: `http://<TM_IP>:<port>/tdkservice/fileStore/lightning-apps/unifiedplayer/build/index.html?url=<video_src_url_short_duration_dash>.mpd&operations=checkloop(30)&autotest=true&type=dash` | Ensure that the launch URL is stored in PersistentStore. |
| 4 | Launch the app through AppManager. | Launch the test app through AppManager using the URL stored in PersistentStore using the following request: <br><code>{"jsonrpc":"2.0", "id":1, "method":"org.rdk.AppManager.1.launchApp", "params":{"appId": "com.rdkcentral.lightning-unified-player"}}</code>. | Ensure that the app launches successfully via AppManager. |
| 5 | Check loaded apps and verify app presence. | Check whether the app is listed in loaded apps using the following request: <br><code>{"jsonrpc": "2.0", "id": 1234567890, "method": "org.rdk.AppManager.getLoadedApps"}</code>. | Verify that com.rdkcentral.lightning-unified-player is present in the loaded apps list. |
| 6 | Run playback operations and validate media events. | App performs playback of dash h264 codec stream. The 'playing' event is monitored to validate successful playback. since loop option is enabled, playback continues from the start after reaching the end. app validates using events and position. loop count is calculated based on number of video position 0 occurred. | Ensure that expected media events are observed for the configured operations. |
| 7 | Validate observed events and update test result. | If expected events playing occurs and video loop count is 1, then app gives the validation result as SUCCESS or else FAILURE. Update the test script result as SUCCESS/FAILURE based on event validation result from the app and proc check status (if applicable) | Ensure that the test result is updated as SUCCESS or FAILURE based on event validation and proc check status. |
| 8 | Terminate app and restore test environment. | Terminate the test app through AppManager using the following request: <br><code>{"jsonrpc":"2.0", "id":1, "method":"org.rdk.AppManager.1.terminateApp", "params":{"appId": "com.rdkcentral.lightning-unified-player"}}</code> and restore the test environment. | Ensure that the app is terminated and the test environment is restored. |
