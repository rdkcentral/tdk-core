## Objective
Test Script to launch a lightning Objects Animation application via AppManager to render given number of rectangles and check whether the average FPS calculated for 60 sec duration value is as expected

<a name="head.Precondition"></a>
## Preconditions
|#| StepName | Step Description | Expected Result |
|-|---------|-----------------|----------------|
| 1 | Verify that the WPEFramework process is running on the device. | WPEFramework process should be up and running in the device. | WPEFramework should be active and running on the device. |
| 2 | Verify that the BOLT package host path is configured correctly. | MediaValidationVariables.bolt_packages_base_path must be configured with the BOLT packages hosting server URL.<br>(E.g. http://<TM_IP>:<port>/images/signed-packages/) | Ensure that the BOLT package host path is configured and accessible. |
| 3 | Verify that the BOLT app download URL resolves correctly. | MediaValidationVariables.object_animation_app_download_url is derived from the base path and must resolve to the BOLT app package URL. | Ensure that the BOLT app package URL is valid and accessible for download. |
| 4 | Verify that the required configuration is set correctly. | MediaValidationVariables.objects_count should be set to the number of animation objects for the test. | Verify that MediaValidationVariables.objects_count is configured with the required value. |
| 5 | Verify that the required interval configuration is set correctly. | MediaValidationVariables.animation_duration should be set to the desired animation duration (in seconds). | Ensure that the required configuration value is set correctly. |
| 6 | Check whether the app is already installed on the device. | Query the installed package list using the following request: <br><code>{"jsonrpc": "2.0", "id": 1234567890, "method": "org.rdk.PackageManagerRDKEMS.1.listPackages"}</code>. | Verify that the app is installed on the device. |
| 7 | Download the app package when it is not already available. | If the app is not installed, then download the package using the following request: <br><code>{"jsonrpc": "2.0", "id": 1234567890, "method": "org.rdk.DownloadManager.1.download", "params": {"url": "<app_download_url>"}}</code>. | Ensure that the app package is downloaded successfully. |
| 8 | Install the downloaded app package through PackageManager. | Install the package using the following request: <br><code>{"jsonrpc": "2.0", "id": 1234567890, "method": "org.rdk.PackageManagerRDKEMS.install", "params": {"packageId": "com.rdkcentral.object-animation-app", "version": "0.1.0", "additionalMetadata": [{"name": "type", "value": "native/dac-app"}], "fileLocator": "<PACKAGEMANAGER_FILE_LOCATOR>/package<download_id>"}}</code>. | Confirm that the app package is installed successfully on the device. |

## Test Steps

|#| StepName | Step Description | Expected Result |
|-|---------|-----------------|----------------|
| 1 | Set playback operations for the scenario. | Configure the animation app URL with parameters: `object=Rect` (renders Rectangles), `count=500` objects, `duration=60` seconds. | Ensure playback operations are set as specified. |
| 2 | Store the launch URL in PersistentStore. | Store the constructed URL in PersistentStore for AppManager launch. <br>Sample URL: `http://<TM_IP>:<port>/tdkservice/fileStore/lightning-apps/objectanimations/build/index.html?port=<device_port>&object=Rect&showfps=true&count=500&duration=60&autotest=true` | Ensure that the launch URL is stored in PersistentStore. |
| 3 | Launch the app through AppManager. | Launch the test app through AppManager using the URL stored in PersistentStore using the following request: <br><code>{"jsonrpc":"2.0", "id":1, "method":"org.rdk.AppManager.1.launchApp", "params":{"appId": "com.rdkcentral.object-animation-app"}}</code>. | Ensure that the app launches successfully via AppManager. |
| 4 | Check loaded apps and verify app presence. | Check whether the app is listed in loaded apps using the following request: <br><code>{"jsonrpc": "2.0", "id": 1234567890, "method": "org.rdk.AppManager.getLoadedApps"}</code>. | Verify that com.rdkcentral.object-animation-app is present in the loaded apps list. |
| 5 | Run playback operations and validate media events. | App performs objects animation by rendering given number of rectangles for 60 sec and stops after that. | Ensure that expected media events are observed for the configured operations. |
| 6 | Validate observed events and update test result. | If expected event is observed, app gives the validation result as SUCCESS or else FAILURE. Update the test script result as SUCCESS/FAILURE based on event validation result and proc check status (if applicable). | Ensure that the test result is updated as SUCCESS or FAILURE based on event validation and proc check status. |
| 7 | Terminate app and restore test environment. | Terminate the test app through AppManager using the following request: <br><code>{"jsonrpc":"2.0", "id":1, "method":"org.rdk.AppManager.1.terminateApp", "params":{"appId": "com.rdkcentral.object-animation-app"}}</code> and restore the test environment. | Ensure that the app is terminated and the test environment is restored. |
