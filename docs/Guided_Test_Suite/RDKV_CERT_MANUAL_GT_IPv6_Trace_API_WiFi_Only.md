## Objective
To validate that the DUT's NetworkManager TraceRoute API successfully traces the IPv6 network path to a configured remote endpoint via the WiFi interface when Ethernet is disconnected. This test confirms IPv6 route traceability is operational over the WiFi-only path, ensuring the DUT's network diagnostic capability for IPv6 traffic.

## Preconditions

|#|Step Name | Step Description| Expected Result|
|-|---------|-----------------|----------------|
| 1 | Verify test script files on DUT | Copy the test script (`IPv6_Automated.sh`), the configuration file (`device.conf`), and the helper script (`generic_functions.sh`) to the working directory of the DUT and ensure all files are accessible. Configure the `device.conf` file with all the correct test environment values specific to this test case prior to execution. | The files `IPv6_Automated.sh`, `device.conf`, and `generic_functions.sh` must be present and accessible in the DUT's working directory. The `device.conf` file must be populated with all the correct test environment values specific to this test case prior to execution. |
| 2 | Connect HDMI display to DUT | Connect an HDMI display/TV to the DUT and ensure the correct HDMI input source is selected on the display. | The HDMI display/TV should be connected to the DUT and the RDK UI should be visible on the screen. |
| 3 | Connect DUT to IPv6 WiFi SSID | Connect the DUT to an IPv6-supported WiFi SSID configured as `<ipv6_conf_SSID>`. | The DUT should be connected to the configured IPv6-supported WiFi SSID and a valid IPv6 address should be assigned to the wlan0 interface. |
| 4 | Disconnect Ethernet cable | Disconnect the Ethernet cable from the DUT to ensure only WiFi connectivity is active. | The Ethernet interface (eth0) should have no IPv4 address assigned on the DUT. |
| 5 | Verify IPv6 SSID connection | Verify the DUT is connected to the correct IPv6 SSID using the NetworkManager API.<br>Command: `curl -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":42,"method":"org.rdk.NetworkManager.1.GetConnectedSSID"}' http://127.0.0.1:9998/jsonrpc` | The DUT should be connected to `<ipv6_conf_SSID>`, a valid IPv6 address should be present on wlan0, and Ethernet should be disconnected. |

## Test Steps

|#|Step Name | Step Description| Expected Result|
|-|---------|-----------------|----------------|
| 1 | Verify trace API to IPv6 endpoint | Execute the curl command to perform an IPv6 trace route to the endpoint `2001:4860:4860::8888`.<br>Command: `curl -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":42,"method":"org.rdk.NetworkManager.1.Trace","params":{"endpoint":"2001:4860:4860::8888","ipversion":"IPv6","packets":1}}' http://127.0.0.1:9998/jsonrpc` | The trace API response should return the endpoint as `2001:4860:4860::8888`, the last hop of the trace should reach `2001:4860:4860::8888`, and success should be true. |
