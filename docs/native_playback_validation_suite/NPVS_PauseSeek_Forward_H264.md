## Objective
Validate pause and forward seek operation on H.264 DASH video streams. The test executes controlled seek operations to a forward position while paused, then resumes playback to verify smooth transition and correct rendering at the seeked location. Confirm playback position advances correctly after seek and frame rendering shows no discontinuities.

## Preconditions

| ID | Step Name | Step Description | Expected Result |
|----|-----------|------------------|-----------------|  
| 1 | TDK Package Installation | TDK_Package must be installed on the Device Under Test (DUT) with `tdk_mediapipelinetests` binary and all dependent libraries | Verify TDK_Package is installed, binary is executable, and all libraries are available |
| 2 | Media Stream Provisioning | DASH stream with MPD manifest must be accessible via HTTPS or local file system (`filesrc`). Stream file configured as `test_streams_base_path + "DASH_H264_AAC/atfms_291_dash_tdk_avc_aac_fmp4.mpd"` in MediaValidationVariables.py. Stream contains H.264 video and AAC audio (DASH container format for pause-seek testing) | Verify master.mpd manifest file is accessible and readable from configured path, dashdemux plugin available for MPD parsing |
| 3 | Stream Variable Configuration | Stream variable `video_src_url_dash_h264` must be configured in `MediaValidationVariables.py` with value: `test_streams_base_path + "DASH_H264_AAC/atfms_291_dash_tdk_avc_aac_fmp4.mpd"` | Verify `video_src_url_dash_h264` resolves to valid DASH manifest URL, manifest contains valid MPD structure with Period, AdaptationSet, Representation elements |
| 4 | Playback Timeout Configuration | Invoke  with GST_SEEK_FLAG_FLUSH to seek forward from current position
| 5 | Platform-Specific Environment Variables | Platform-specific environment variables (`WAYLAND_DISPLAY`, `XDG_RUNTIME_DIR`, `LD_PRELOAD` with vendor libraries, ) must be defined in `/opt/TDK/TDK.env` | Verify `/opt/TDK/TDK.env` exists and contains all required environment variables |

## Test Steps

| ID | StepName | Step Description | Expected Result |
|----|----------|------------------|-----------------|  
| 1 | Initialize Test Environment | Initialize test environment by sourcing variables from `/opt/TDK/TDK.env` and establish Wayland display session via RDKWindowManager | Verify environment variables load correctly and Wayland display is created |
| 2 | Configure and Execute Test Application | Retrieve configuration and stream URL, then execute `tdk_mediapipelinetests` with test case name, stream URL, and timeout arguments. Load H264 stream configuration from MediaValidationVariables.py | Verify configuration is retrieved and `tdk_mediapipelinetests` initializes playbin pipeline for H264 stream |
| 3 | Construct Pipeline and Initiate Playback | Create `playbin` element with H264 stream URI, set `westerossink` as video sink, trigger `NULL→READY→PAUSED→PLAYING` state transition, verify `first-video-frame-callback` signal | Verify `playbin` reaches  with first frame rendered from H264 stream, no  |
| 4 | Execute Pause-Then-Seek Operation |  after reaching intermediate playback position. Query current position via . Invoke  to seek forward to `NATIVE_PLAYBACK_SEEK_POSITION` | Verify pipeline pauses successfully, position query returns valid paused position, forward seek completes within 1 second |
| 5 | Monitor Playback Progress | Resume  after seek. Poll playback position via  at 100ms intervals to verify position advances at normal playback rate (±250ms tolerance per second) | Verify playback resumes from seeked position without stalls, position advances smoothly without backward jumps |
| 6 | Validate Frame Rendering | Query `westerossink2192stats` to extract `rendered_frames` increments and `dropped_frames` remains acceptable | Verify frame statistics indicate proper video rendering |
| 7 | Validate Test Success Indicators | Parse GCheck framework output and verify test-specific metrics match expected values | Verify GCheck shows `Failures: 0`, `Errors: 0`, and metrics are correct |
| 8 | Release Pipeline Resources | Set pipeline state to  and release all codec, decoder, and sink resources | Verify pipeline reaches  and system restored to pre-test state |
