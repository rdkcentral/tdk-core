## Objective
To validate that the system resource usage (CPU and memory) remains within acceptable limits both after the first launch and after relaunching an application via the AppManager, confirming that resource consumption does not increase upon repeated launches.

## Preconditions
|#|StepName | Step Description| Expected Result|
|-|---------|-----------------|----------------|
| 1 | Confirm WPEFramework is running | WPEFramework process must be active and responsive on the device under test. | WPEFramework should be up and running on the device. |
| 2 | Configure device reboot preference | The user should configure `PRE_REQ_REBOOT_PVS` as `Yes` to reboot the device before test execution, or as `No` to skip reboot before test execution. | The device should reboot or skip reboot as configured before test execution begins. |
| 3 | Configure google_bundle in PerformanceTestVariables | `google_bundle` must be set to the application bundle filename in PerformanceTestVariables. | The google_bundle variable should be configured with a valid application bundle name. |
| 4 | Configure app_download_url in PerformanceTestVariables | `app_download_url` must be set to the base URL where the application bundle is hosted. | The app_download_url should point to a reachable hosting location. |

## Test Steps

|#|StepName | Step Description| Expected Result|
|-|---------|-----------------|----------------|
| 1 | Verify and activate required plugins | Query and activate the required plugins to ensure they are in the activated state. <br>`{"jsonrpc": "2.0", "id": 1234567890, "method": "Controller.1.status@org.rdk.DownloadManager"}` <br><br>`{"jsonrpc": "2.0", "id": 1234567890, "method": "Controller.1.status@org.rdk.PackageManagerRDKEMS"}` <br><br>`{"jsonrpc": "2.0", "id": 1234567890, "method": "Controller.1.status@org.rdk.AppManager"}` <br>Activate if needed: `{"jsonrpc": "2.0", "id": 1234567890, "method": "Controller.1.activate", "params": {"callsign": "<plugin_name>"}}` | All required plugins should be in the activated state. |
| 2 | Download the application bundle | Download the application bundle from the configured URL via the DownloadManager. <br>`{"jsonrpc": "2.0", "id": 1234567890, "method": "org.rdk.DownloadManager.1.download", "params": {"url": "<app_download_url>/<google_bundle>"}}` | The download should complete successfully and a download ID should be returned. |
| 3 | Install the application | Install the downloaded application bundle. <br>`{"jsonrpc": "2.0", "id": 1234567890, "method": "org.rdk.PackageManagerRDKEMS.install", "params": {"packageId": "com.rdkcentral.google", "version": "0.1.0", "additionalMetadata": [{"name": "type", "value": "native/dac-app"}], "fileLocator": "<PACKAGEMANAGER_FILE_LOCATOR>/package<download_id>"}}` | The application should be installed successfully. |
| 4 | Perform first launch of the application | Launch the application for the first time. <br>`{"jsonrpc": "2.0", "id": 1234567890, "method": "org.rdk.AppManager.launchApp", "params": {"appId": "com.rdkcentral.google", "intent": "", "launchArgs": ""}}` | The application should launch successfully and enter the APP_STATE_ACTIVE state. |
| 5 | Validate resource usage after first launch | Allow 10 seconds for the app to stabilize after the first launch, then measure and validate the system CPU and memory usage against the configured resource usage thresholds. Invoke the DeviceInfo systeminfo API to retrieve current system metrics: <br>`{"jsonrpc": "2.0", "id": 1234567890, "method": "DeviceInfo.1.systeminfo"}` <br>Extract CPU load from the `cpuload` field and calculate memory usage using the formula `(totalram - freeram) / totalram × 100`. | System resource usage after the first launch should be within the configured acceptable limits. |
| 6 | Terminate the application | Send a terminate request after capturing the first-launch resource metrics. <br>`{"jsonrpc": "2.0", "id": 1234567890, "method": "org.rdk.AppManager.terminateApp", "params": {"appId": "com.rdkcentral.google"}}` | The application should be terminated successfully. |
| 7 | Relaunch the application (second launch) | After a 5-second pause, send a second launch request to relaunch the application. <br>`{"jsonrpc": "2.0", "id": 1234567890, "method": "org.rdk.AppManager.launchApp", "params": {"appId": "com.rdkcentral.google", "intent": "", "launchArgs": ""}}` | The application should relaunch successfully and return to the APP_STATE_ACTIVE state. |
| 8 | Validate resource usage after relaunch | Allow 10 seconds for stabilization after the relaunch, then measure and validate CPU and memory usage again to confirm no resource increase occurred upon relaunching. Invoke the DeviceInfo systeminfo API to retrieve current system metrics: <br>`{"jsonrpc": "2.0", "id": 1234567890, "method": "DeviceInfo.1.systeminfo"}` <br>Extract CPU load from the `cpuload` field and calculate memory usage using the formula `(totalram - freeram) / totalram × 100`. | System resource usage after the relaunch should remain within the configured acceptable limits and should not exhibit significant growth compared to the first-launch measurement. |
| 9 | Terminate the application for final cleanup | Send a final terminate request to clean up the relaunched application. <br>`{"jsonrpc": "2.0", "id": 1234567890, "method": "org.rdk.AppManager.terminateApp", "params": {"appId": "com.rdkcentral.google"}}` | The application should be terminated successfully. |
