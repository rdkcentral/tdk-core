## Objective
To validate that the system resource usage (CPU and memory) remains within acceptable limits during runtime operation of an application managed by the AppManager, by periodically sampling resource metrics over a 60-second monitoring period.

## Preconditions
|#|Step Name | Step Description| Expected Result|
|-|---------|-----------------|----------------|
| 1 | Confirm WPEFramework is running | WPEFramework process must be active and responsive on the device under test. | WPEFramework should be up and running on the device. |
| 2 | Configure device reboot preference | The user should configure `PRE_REQ_REBOOT_PVS` as `Yes` to reboot the device before test execution, or as `No` to skip reboot before test execution. | The device should reboot or skip reboot as configured before test execution begins. |
| 3 | Configure google_bundle in PerformanceTestVariables | `google_bundle` must be set to the application bundle filename in PerformanceTestVariables. | The google_bundle variable should be configured with a valid application bundle name. |
| 4 | Configure app_download_url in PerformanceTestVariables | `app_download_url` must be set to the base URL where the application bundle is hosted. | The app_download_url should point to a reachable hosting location. |

## Test Steps

|#|Step Name | Step Description| Expected Result|
|-|---------|-----------------|----------------|
| 1 | Verify and activate required plugins | Query and activate the AppManager and RuntimeManager plugins to ensure they are in the activated state. <br>`{"jsonrpc": "2.0", "id": 1234567890, "method": "Controller.1.status@org.rdk.AppManager"}` <br><br>`{"jsonrpc": "2.0", "id": 1234567890, "method": "Controller.1.status@org.rdk.RuntimeManager"}` <br>Activate if needed: `{"jsonrpc": "2.0", "id": 1234567890, "method": "Controller.1.activate", "params": {"callsign": "<plugin_name>"}}` | Both AppManager and RuntimeManager plugins should be in the activated state. |
| 2 | Download the application bundle | Download the application bundle from the configured URL via the DownloadManager. <br>`{"jsonrpc": "2.0", "id": 1234567890, "method": "org.rdk.DownloadManager.1.download", "params": {"url": "<app_download_url>/<google_bundle>"}}` | The download should complete successfully and a download ID should be returned. |
| 3 | Install the application | Install the downloaded application bundle on the device. <br>`{"jsonrpc": "2.0", "id": 1234567890, "method": "org.rdk.PackageManagerRDKEMS.install", "params": {"packageId": "com.rdkcentral.google", "version": "0.1.0", "additionalMetadata": [{"name": "type", "value": "native/dac-app"}], "fileLocator": "<PACKAGEMANAGER_FILE_LOCATOR>/package<download_id>"}}` | The application should be installed successfully. |
| 4 | Launch the application | Send a launch request for the application. <br>`{"jsonrpc": "2.0", "id": 1234567890, "method": "org.rdk.AppManager.launchApp", "params": {"appId": "com.rdkcentral.google", "intent": "", "launchArgs": ""}}` | The application should launch successfully and enter the APP_STATE_ACTIVE state. |
| 5 | Periodically monitor resource usage during 60-second runtime | Begin runtime resource monitoring immediately after launch. Sample system CPU and memory usage every 5 seconds for a total duration of 60 seconds (12 samples). Each sample validates that resource usage is within the configured acceptable limits. For each sample, invoke the DeviceInfo systeminfo API: <br>`{"jsonrpc": "2.0", "id": 1234567890, "method": "DeviceInfo.1.systeminfo"}` <br>Extract CPU load from the `cpuload` field and calculate memory usage using the formula `(totalram - freeram) / totalram × 100`. | Each of the 12 resource usage samples taken at 5-second intervals should report CPU and memory values within the configured acceptable limits throughout the 60-second monitoring window. |
| 6 | Terminate the application | After the 60-second monitoring period completes, send a terminate request to stop the application. <br>`{"jsonrpc": "2.0", "id": 1234567890, "method": "org.rdk.AppManager.terminateApp", "params": {"appId": "com.rdkcentral.google"}}` | The application should be terminated successfully after the runtime monitoring period. |
