## Objective
To validate that the system resource usage (CPU and memory) remains within acceptable limits after killing an application via the AppManager killApp API.

<a name="head.Precondition"></a>
## Preconditions
|#|Step Name | Step Description| Expected Result|
|-|---------|-----------------|----------------|
| 1 | Confirm WPEFramework is running | WPEFramework process must be active and responsive on the device under test. | WPEFramework should be up and running on the device. |
| 2 | Configure device reboot preference | The user should configure `PRE_REQ_REBOOT_PVS` as `Yes` to reboot the device before test execution, or as `No` to skip reboot before test execution. | The device should reboot or skip reboot as configured before test execution begins. |
| 3 | Configure google_bundle in PerformanceTestVariables | `google_bundle` must be set to the application bundle filename in PerformanceTestVariables. | The google_bundle variable should be configured with a valid application bundle name. |
| 4 | Configure app_download_url in PerformanceTestVariables | `app_download_url` must be set to the base URL where the application bundle is hosted in PerformanceTestVariables. | The app_download_url should point to a reachable hosting location. |
| 5 | Configure PACKAGEMANAGER_FILE_LOCATOR in device config | `PACKAGEMANAGER_FILE_LOCATOR` must be set to the correct path where downloaded packages are stored on the device. | The file locator path should be correctly configured. |

## Test Steps

|#|Step Name | Step Description| Expected Result|
|-|---------|-----------------|----------------|
| 1 | Verify and activate required plugins | Check the activation state of the required plugins: org.rdk.DownloadManager, org.rdk.PackageManagerRDKEMS, and org.rdk.AppManager. Activate any that are not already in the activated state. <br>`{"jsonrpc": "2.0", "id": 1234567890, "method": "Controller.1.status@<plugin_name>"}` <br><br>`{"jsonrpc": "2.0", "id": 1234567890, "method": "Controller.1.activate", "params": {"callsign": "<plugin_name>"}}` | All three required plugins should be in activated state. |
| 2 | Check if the application is already installed | Query the installed packages list to determine whether the application is already present on the device. <br>`{"jsonrpc": "2.0", "id": 1234567890, "method": "org.rdk.PackageManagerRDKEMS.1.listPackages"}` | The installed packages list should be returned successfully. |
| 3 | Download the application bundle | If the application is not already installed, download the application bundle from the configured URL via the DownloadManager. This step is skipped if the application was found to be already installed in the previous step. <br>`{"jsonrpc": "2.0", "id": 1234567890, "method": "org.rdk.DownloadManager.1.download", "params": {"url": "<app_download_url>/<google_bundle>"}}` | The download should complete successfully and a download ID should be returned. |
| 4 | Install the application | Install the downloaded application bundle without launching it. <br>`{"jsonrpc": "2.0", "id": 1234567890, "method": "org.rdk.PackageManagerRDKEMS.install", "params": {"packageId": "com.rdkcentral.google", "version": "0.1.0", "additionalMetadata": [{"name": "type", "value": "native/dac-app"}], "fileLocator": "<PACKAGEMANAGER_FILE_LOCATOR>/package<download_id>"}}` | The application should be installed successfully and appear in the installed packages list. |
| 5 | Launch the application | Send a launch request for the installed application via AppManager and wait 10 seconds after launch to allow the application to reach a stable state. <br>`{"jsonrpc": "2.0", "id": 1234567890, "method": "org.rdk.AppManager.launchApp", "params": {"appId": "com.rdkcentral.google", "intent": "", "launchArgs": ""}}` | The application should launch successfully and reach APP_STATE_ACTIVE. |
| 6 | Kill the application | Send a killApp request to the AppManager to forcefully kill the running application. <br>`{"jsonrpc": "2.0", "id": 1234567890, "method": "org.rdk.AppManager.killApp", "params": {"appId": "com.rdkcentral.google"}}` | The killApp request should return SUCCESS and the application should be killed. |
| 7 | Validate resource usage after killing the app | Measure and validate the system CPU and memory usage after the application has been killed. Invoke the DeviceInfo systeminfo API to retrieve current system metrics: <br>`{"jsonrpc": "2.0", "id": 1234567890, "method": "DeviceInfo.1.systeminfo"}` <br>Extract CPU load from the `cpuload` field and calculate memory usage using the formula `(totalram - freeram) / totalram × 100`. | Resource usage (CPU and memory) should be within the expected limits after killing the application. No unexpected resource spikes should be observed. |
