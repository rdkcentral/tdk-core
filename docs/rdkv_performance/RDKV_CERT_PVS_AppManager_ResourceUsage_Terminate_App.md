## Objective
To validate that the system resource usage (CPU and memory) remains within the configured acceptable limits after terminating a running application via the AppManager.

## Preconditions
|#|StepName | Step Description| Expected Result|
|-|---------|-----------------|----------------|
| 1 | Confirm WPEFramework is running | WPEFramework process must be active and responsive on the device under test. | WPEFramework should be up and running on the device. |
| 2 | Confirm required plugins are available | The following plugins must be present and activatable: org.rdk.DownloadManager, org.rdk.PackageManagerRDKEMS, org.rdk.AppManager. | All required plugins should be available in the build. |
| 3 | Configure device reboot preference | The user should configure `PRE_REQ_REBOOT_PVS` as `Yes` to reboot the device before test execution, or as `No` to skip reboot before test execution. | The device should reboot or skip reboot as configured before test execution begins. |
| 4 | Configure google_bundle in PerformanceTestVariables | `google_bundle` must be set to the application bundle filename in PerformanceTestVariables. | The google_bundle variable should be configured with a valid application bundle name. |
| 5 | Configure app_download_url in PerformanceTestVariables | `app_download_url` must be set to the base URL where the application bundle is hosted. | The app_download_url should point to a reachable hosting location. |
| 6 | Configure PACKAGEMANAGER_FILE_LOCATOR in device config | `PACKAGEMANAGER_FILE_LOCATOR` must be set to the correct path where downloaded packages are stored on the device. | The file locator path should be correctly configured. |

## Test Steps

|#|StepName | Step Description| Expected Result|
|-|---------|-----------------|----------------|
| 1 | Verify and activate required plugins | Query and activate the required plugins to ensure they are in the activated state. <br>`{"jsonrpc": "2.0", "id": 1234567890, "method": "Controller.1.status@org.rdk.DownloadManager"}` <br>`{"jsonrpc": "2.0", "id": 1234567890, "method": "Controller.1.status@org.rdk.PackageManagerRDKEMS"}` <br>`{"jsonrpc": "2.0", "id": 1234567890, "method": "Controller.1.status@org.rdk.AppManager"}` <br>Activate if needed: `{"jsonrpc": "2.0", "id": 1234567890, "method": "Controller.1.activate", "params": {"callsign": "<plugin_name>"}}` | All required plugins should be in the activated state. |
| 2 | Install and launch the application | Download, install, and launch the application so it is in the active running state before termination. <br>Download: `{"jsonrpc": "2.0", "id": 1234567890, "method": "org.rdk.DownloadManager.1.download", "params": {"url": "<app_download_url>/<google_bundle>"}}` <br>Install: `{"jsonrpc": "2.0", "id": 1234567890, "method": "org.rdk.PackageManagerRDKEMS.install", "params": {"packageId": "com.rdkcentral.google", "version": "0.1.0", "additionalMetadata": [{"name": "type", "value": "native/dac-app"}], "fileLocator": "<PACKAGEMANAGER_FILE_LOCATOR>/package<download_id>"}}` <br>Launch: `{"jsonrpc": "2.0", "id": 1234567890, "method": "org.rdk.AppManager.launchApp", "params": {"appId": "com.rdkcentral.google", "intent": "", "launchArgs": ""}}` | The application should be installed and launched successfully and should be in the APP_STATE_ACTIVE state. |
| 3 | Terminate the application | Send a terminate request to stop the running application. <br>`{"jsonrpc": "2.0", "id": 1234567890, "method": "org.rdk.AppManager.terminateApp", "params": {"appId": "com.rdkcentral.google"}}` | The application should be terminated successfully. |
| 4 | Validate system resource usage post-termination | After termination completes, measure and validate the system CPU and memory usage against the configured resource usage thresholds to confirm no resources were leaked by the app process. Invoke the DeviceInfo systeminfo API to retrieve current system metrics: <br>`{"jsonrpc": "2.0", "id": 1234567890, "method": "DeviceInfo.1.systeminfo"}` <br>Extract CPU load from the `cpuload` field and calculate memory usage using the formula `(totalram - freeram) / totalram × 100`. | Resource usage (CPU and memory) should be within the expected limits after app termination. No resource leaks should be observed following the terminate operation. |
